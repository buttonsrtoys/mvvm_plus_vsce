# mvvm-plus README

Adds "MVVM+" editor command for adding a View and ViewModel templates (similar to how 'stful' adds StatefulWidget and State classes).

## Features

Just start typing "mvvm+" in the edit window and hit `Enter`. This extension adds the class. Then start typing the name of you widget and this extension will populate the naming for you.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

Install the `mvvm_plus` package and pub.dev. See [mvvm_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/mvvm_plus)
